It is designed for agile teams who estimate their effort for certain tasks.\r\n\r\nI call it 3.0 because I believe that this is the next level. Therefore this tool is considered to aim advanced agile people. I am not covering basic agile and estimation topic here.\r\n\r\nFor more information about estimation, please refer to the [Almighty](http://google.com)\r\n\r\n## The Idea\r\n\r\nThe idea of the “next generation estimation” is to increase performance and accuracy of estimation and reduce time waste at the same time. See, the main cause of slowness in the planning poker technique is that players have to make turns blindly.\r\n\r\nWith comparative approach, players don’t estimate blindly and therefore the time is saved.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
